    "We can see that the training loss is becoming much smaller than the validation loss after the 20th iteration. This means that our model starts to overfit our training dataset after too much epochs. That is why the validation loss does not decrease a lot after. One solution consists in early-stopping the training of the model. \n",

    "We could also use some different dropout values and performing data augmentation. Those methods were tested on this dataset, but they did not significantly increase the validation accuracy although they reduced the overfitting effect. Using them slightly increased the training duration of the model.\n",
